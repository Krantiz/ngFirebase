First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

=== Database Setup

Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be
structured and when your data can be read from and written to.

? What file should be used for Database Rules? database.rules.json
+  Database Rules for myngfire have been downloaded to database.rules.json.
Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Database Rules when you run
firebase deploy.

=== Firestore Setup

Firestore Security Rules allow you to define how and when to allow
requests. You can keep these rules in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

=== Functions Setup

A functions directory will be created in your project with a Node.js
package pre-configured. Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.

will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.
